# Unit IV

👋 Ansible and YAML

## What is YAML?

YAML stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language." It is a human-readable data serialization format that is often used for configuration files and data exchange between languages with different data structures. YAML emphasizes simplicity and readability, making it popular among developers and system administrators.

## Benefits of YAML

1. Language-independent: YAML is not tied to any specific programming language or platform. It can be used with a wide range of programming languages, making it a versatile choice for configuration files, data serialization, and more.
2. Support for complex data structures: YAML supports a variety of data structures, including lists, dictionaries, scalars, and nested structures. This flexibility allows for representing complex data hierarchies and relationships.
3. Integration-friendly: YAML integrates well with other technologies and tools. It is commonly used for configuration files in applications and can be easily parsed and generated by various programming languages and frameworks.
4. Version control-friendly: YAML files are typically plain text, making them easily manageable with version control systems such as Git. Changes to YAML files can be tracked, compared, and merged, facilitating collaboration and maintaining a history of configuration changes.
5. Platform-agnostic: YAML can be used across different operating systems and platforms. It is supported by a wide range of programming languages, libraries, and frameworks, enabling interoperability and portability.

## Where is YAML used?

1. Configuration files: YAML is often used to specify settings, parameters, and options in software applications and systems. Many frameworks and tools, including Ansible, Kubernetes, and Docker Compose, use YAML for configuration because it is easy to read.
2. Data serialization: YAML is used to store and transmit data in a format that is lightweight and easy to read. This makes it a good choice for representing hierarchical data structures.
3. Continuous integration and deployment: YAML is commonly used in tools like Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD to automate the software delivery process. Developers can define their workflows using YAML files.
4. Documentation: YAML is used to document software projects, APIs, and data schemas. Swagger/OpenAPI, for example, uses YAML to describe RESTful APIs, including their endpoints, request/response models, and authentication requirements, in a structured and readable format that can be easily maintained and version controlled.

## Syntax

YAML uses indentation and whitespace to structure data, instead of using brackets or other delimiters like JSON or XML. Here are some key syntax rules:

- YAML files use the `.yaml` or `.yml` file extension.
- YAML documents start with three hyphens (`---`) and end with three dots (`...`).
- Comments start with the `#` symbol and continue until the end of the line.
- Key-value pairs are represented using a colon (`:`) and a space.
- Lists are represented using a hyphen (``) followed by a space for each list item.
- YAML is whitespace-sensitive, and indentation determines the structure.

Example YAML document:

```yaml
---
# This is a YAML example
name: John Doe
age: 30
hobbies:
  - Reading
  - Cooking
...
```

## Data Types in YAML

- Scalars: Scalars represent single values such as strings, numbers, booleans, and null.

```yaml
---
name: Devesh Shivane
age: 30
employed: false
score: 9.5
empty_value: null
...
```

- Lists: Lists are represented by hyphens (``) followed by a space for each item.

```yaml
---
fruits:
  - apple
  - banana
  - orange
...
```

- Multiline strings: Strings can span multiple lines using the `|` or `>` character. The `|` preserves line breaks, while `>` folds them.

```yaml
---
description: |
  This is a multiline
  string in YAML.
...
```

- Objects (Maps): Objects in YAML are represented as maps using key-value pairs. The key and value are separated by a colon (`:`), and each key-value pair is indented by spaces.

```yaml
person:
  name: John Doe
  age: 30
  address:
    street: 123 Main St
    city: New York
```

In this example, `person` is the key, and its corresponding value is another map containing `name`, `age`, and `address`.

- Placeholders: Placeholders in YAML can be used to represent dynamic values that can be substituted later. In YAML, placeholders are typically denoted using curly braces (`{}`) and can be combined with strings. Here's an example:

```yaml
greeting: Hello, {name}!
```

In this example, `{name}` is a placeholder that can be replaced with an actual value when processing the YAML document.

- Environment Variables: Each key-value pair within the **`env`** dictionary represents an environment variable, where the key is the variable name and the value is its assigned value.

```yaml
env:
  VARIABLE_NAME: variable_value
  ANOTHER_VARIABLE: another_value

```

In the example above, two environment variables are defined: **`VARIABLE_NAME`** with the value **`variable_value`**, and **`ANOTHER_VARIABLE`** with the value **`another_value`**.

- YAML allows referencing environment variables using the syntax `$ENV_VAR_NAME` or `${ENV_VAR_NAME}`.

```yaml
database:
  host: $VARIABLE_NAME
  port: ${ANOTHER_VARIABLE}

```

In this example, `$DB_HOST` and `${DB_PORT}` are environment variables that can be substituted with their corresponding values from the environment where the YAML is being processed.

## YAML Tools

There are several tools available for working with YAML, including:

- YAML parsers: Libraries and tools that parse YAML documents into data structures in various programming languages. Examples include PyYAML (Python), SnakeYAML (Java), and yaml-cpp (C++).
- Editors and IDEs: Many code editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) provide YAML syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and validation. Some popular editors for YAML include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, and Atom.
- YAML validators: Online tools and command-line utilities that check the syntax and structure of YAML documents to ensure they are valid. These tools can help catch errors and typos. **Examples include yamllint and online validators like YAML Lint.**
- YAML converters: Tools that convert YAML files to other formats, such as JSON or XML. This can be useful when working with systems that require a different data format. There are online converters available, as well as libraries that provide conversion capabilities.

## Ansible

### Ansible Introduction

- What is Ansible: Ansible is an open-source automation tool designed to simplify IT tasks, such as infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. It follows a declarative approach, where you define the desired state of your infrastructure, and Ansible takes care of applying the necessary changes to achieve that state.
- Provisioning: Provisioning refers to the process of setting up and configuring infrastructure resources required for an application or system. With Ansible, you can automate the provisioning of servers, virtual machines, networking components, and other resources, enabling fast and consistent infrastructure setup.
- Automation: Automation involves automating repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort, and increasing operational efficiency. Ansible automates IT processes by executing tasks in a repeatable, reliable, and scalable manner, freeing up time for IT teams to focus on more strategic activities.

### Ansible Core:

Ansible Core is an open-source automation platform created by Red Hat. It uses YAML to define automation tasks and playbooks, and SSH to connect and execute commands on remote systems.

### Ansible Tower:

Ansible Tower is a commercial product built on top of Ansible Core. It provides a web-based user interface, role-based access control, and additional features to enhance the management, scalability, and visibility of Ansible automation.

### Ansible Galaxy:

Ansible Galaxy is a community-driven platform for sharing Ansible roles, modules, and playbooks. It serves as a repository where users can find and contribute to a wide range of pre-built automation content. Ansible Galaxy promotes code reuse and collaboration by allowing users to publish and download reusable components. Ansible Tower integrates with Ansible Galaxy, allowing users to use community-contributed content in their automation workflows.

### Why Use Ansible:

- Why Use Ansible: Ansible offers several benefits that make it a popular choice for IT automation:
    - Agentless: Ansible operates over SSH and does not require agents to be installed on managed hosts. This simplifies deployment and reduces the overhead of managing additional software.
    - Declarative: Ansible uses YAML-based playbooks to define the desired state of infrastructure. This declarative approach allows for easy-to-understand and self-documented configurations.
    - Idempotent: Ansible ensures idempotence, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects. If the desired state matches the actual state, no changes are made.
    - Extensible: Ansible provides a rich set of modules that cover various use cases, and you can extend its functionality by writing custom modules or leveraging community-contributed modules.
    
    ![Untitled](Cloud%20Computing%20b676dba0157549af9cbbb9405bbda7f3/Untitled.png)
    
- Architecture and Process Flow: Ansible follows a client-server architecture, consisting of:
    - Control Machine: The control machine is where Ansible is installed and from where automation tasks are executed. It can be a developer's workstation, a dedicated server, or a CI/CD pipeline.
    - Managed Hosts: These are the target systems that Ansible manages. They can be physical servers, virtual machines, network devices, or cloud instances.
    - Inventory: The inventory is a list of managed hosts and their associated details, such as IP addresses, hostnames, or groups. It serves as the basis for defining the target hosts for Ansible tasks.
    - Playbooks: Playbooks are YAML files that define the desired state and the tasks required to achieve that state. Playbooks consist of plays, which are sets of tasks executed against specified hosts.
    - Modules: Modules are the building blocks of Ansible tasks. They are small units of code responsible for executing specific actions, such as managing packages, configuring services, or interacting with cloud APIs.
    - Execution Flow: When executing a playbook, Ansible connects to the managed hosts via SSH and transfers the necessary modules and temporary scripts. It then applies the defined tasks to the hosts, following the order specified in the playbook.
    - Reporting and Outputs: Ansible provides detailed execution reports and outputs, allowing you to track task results, identify any issues, and gain insights into the automation process.

### Components Overview:

- Control Machine: The control machine is where Ansible is installed and from where automation tasks are initiated. It acts as the central point for managing infrastructure and executing Ansible playbooks and modules.
- Inventory: The inventory is a file or collection of files that contain a list of managed hosts and their associated information, such as IP addresses, hostnames, or groups. It allows Ansible to target specific hosts or groups of hosts for executing tasks.

```
[web_servers]
web1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
web2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11

[database_servers]
db1 ansible_host=192.168.1.20
```

- Playbooks: Playbooks are written in YAML and define the desired state of infrastructure and the steps to achieve that state. Playbooks consist of plays, which are sets of tasks that are executed against specific hosts or groups of hosts.

```yaml
---
- name: Deploy application
  hosts: web_servers
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Update system packages
      apt:
        name: "*"
        state: latest

    - name: Copy application files
      copy:
        src: /path/to/app
        dest: /var/www/html/

    - name: Restart web server
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: restarted
```

- Modules: Ansible uses modules, which are small units of code that perform specific actions on managed hosts. Its library of modules covers tasks, including managing packages, configuring services, manipulating files, and interacting with cloud platforms.
- Variables: Ansible allows defining variables to achieve flexible and reusable playbooks and templates. Variables can be defined at different levels, allowing customization and dynamic configuration.
- Templates: Templates are files with placeholders that Ansible can fill in with variables or facts specific to each managed host. They enable dynamic configuration generation and can be used for various files, such as configuration files or scripts.
- Handlers: Handlers are tasks that are only executed when a notified condition is met. They are typically used to trigger specific actions in response to changes made during playbook execution, such as restarting a service after a configuration file change.

### Process of Execution and Flow:

- Gathering Facts: Ansible collects information about hosts before running tasks. This includes network interfaces, OS details, hardware specs, or custom facts. Facts can be used in playbooks or templates for dynamic decisions.
- Task Execution: Ansible connects to hosts via SSH and executes tasks in the playbook. Tasks can perform actions such as installing packages, configuring services, modifying files, or running commands.
- Reporting and Outputs: Ansible provides detailed reporting and outputs for tracking task results. It displays information on task success, failure, and changes made during the playbook run. This helps with troubleshooting and verifying task success.

### Execution Types:

- Ad-hoc Execution: Ad-hoc execution allows you to execute a single Ansible module or a small set of modules against one or more managed hosts without the need for writing a playbook. It is useful for quick and simple tasks, such as running commands or gathering specific information from hosts. **(Refer PPT for Ad-hoc command examples)**
- Playbook Execution: Playbook execution is the primary method for Ansible automation. Playbooks provide a structured and repeatable way to define tasks, apply configurations, and manage infrastructure. They allow for complex orchestration and automation scenarios by executing multiple plays and tasks in a specific order. **(Refer Ansible Assignment for Playbook Execution)**

```powershell
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini deploy_app.yml
```

### How to use ansible

1. Installing Ansible:
When installing Ansible on the control machine, you typically follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system. Ansible can be installed using package managers like apt or yum, or you can use Python's package manager, pip. Once installed, you can verify the installation by running the `ansible --version` command, which displays the installed version of Ansible.
2. Playbooks Introduction:
Playbooks are at the heart of Ansible automation. They are written in YAML format and contain a series of plays, which are collections of tasks executed against hosts or groups of hosts. Playbooks allow you to define the desired state of the infrastructure and the steps to achieve that state. They provide a structured and reusable approach to automation.
3. Packages (apt):
Ansible provides modules to manage package installation and removal. The `apt` module, specifically designed for Debian-based systems, allows you to install, upgrade, or remove packages using the `apt` package manager. Here's an example:

```yaml
- name: Install package
  apt:
    name: package-name
    state: present
```

In this example, the `apt` module installs the specified package (`package-name`) if it is not already installed (`state: present`).

- Become:
The `become` keyword in Ansible allows you to escalate privileges and run tasks as a different user, typically using the `sudo` command. It is useful for performing administrative tasks that require elevated permissions. You can specify `become: yes` at the play or task level in your playbook to enable privilege escalation.

```yaml
- name: Install package as root
  apt:
    name: package-name
    state: present
  become: yes
```

In this example, the task is executed with elevated privileges.

- with_items:
The `with_items` loop construct in Ansible allows you to iterate over a list of items and perform a task multiple times with different values. It is useful when you need to repeat a task for each item in a list. Here's an example:

```yaml
- name: Install multiple packages
  apt:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
  with_items:
    - package1
    - package2
    - package3

```

In this example, the `apt` module is used to install multiple packages specified in the `with_items` loop. The task is executed once for each item in the list.

- Services (service):
The `service` module in Ansible allows you to manage services on remote hosts. You can start, stop, restart, or enable/disable services using this module. Here's an example:

```yaml
- name: Restart service
  service:
    name: service-name
    state: restarted

```

In this example, the `service` module restarts the specified service (`service-name`) on the managed host.

These are detailed notes on Ansible playbook concepts related to installing Ansible, playbook introduction, and working with packages (apt), privilege escalation (become), loops (with_items), and services (service)

### Inventory Fundamentals

- Inventory in Ansible is a file or collection of files that define the managed hosts and their associated properties.
- The inventory file can be written in INI or YAML format, which allows you to organize and group hosts based on different criteria.
- Each host entry in the inventory typically includes information such as the host's IP address, hostname, SSH port, and optional variables.
- Inventory files can be stored locally on the control machine or fetched dynamically from external sources like cloud platforms or inventory management systems.

### Ansible Modules Fundamentals:

- Modules in Ansible are reusable units of code that perform specific tasks on managed hosts.
- Ansible provides a vast library of built-in modules that cover a wide range of use cases, including package management, file manipulation, service configuration, cloud provisioning, and more.
- Modules are executed on the managed hosts by Ansible and are responsible for making the necessary changes to achieve the desired state defined in the playbook.
- Each module has its own set of parameters that can be configured to customize its behavior.
- Modules can be used directly within tasks in a playbook or called from within a role.

### Roles: Role Basics:

- Roles in Ansible provide a way to organize and package playbooks, variables, templates, and other files into reusable units.
- A role represents a specific function or responsibility within a playbook, such as installing a web server, configuring a database, or setting up a monitoring system.
- Roles follow a standardized directory structure, making it easier to share and reuse them across different projects.
- The main components of a role include directories for tasks, templates, variables, and handlers.
- Tasks directory: Contains YAML files defining the tasks to be executed by the role.
- Templates directory: Contains Jinja2 templates that can be used to generate configuration files dynamically.
- Variables directory: Contains variable files specific to the role, allowing for customizable and flexible configuration.
- Handlers directory: Contains handlers, which are tasks that are triggered by events and can be used to restart services or perform other actions in response to changes made during playbook execution.
- Roles can be included in playbooks using the `roles` keyword, and variables can be passed to roles to customize their behavior.

Example Role Structure:

```
my_role/
├── tasks/
│   └── main.yml
├── templates/
├── vars/
│   └── main.yml
├── handlers/
│   └── main.yml
└── meta/
    └── main.yml

```

In this example, `my_role` is the name of the role. The `tasks` directory contains the main task file (`main.yml`) defining the tasks for the role. The `templates` directory holds the Jinja2 templates. The `vars` directory contains variable files specific to the role. The `handlers` directory contains the handlers for the role. The `meta` directory contains metadata for the role, including dependencies and other role-related information.

# Unit - IV Application Based Questions (6 marks)

**Q. You are a system administrator responsible for managing a large fleet of servers. Explain how Ansible can be used for provisioning and automation in this environment. Discuss the benefits of using Ansible in terms of efficiency, scalability, and repeatability. (6 marks)**

Ansible allows for the automation of repetitive tasks and configuration management across multiple servers. It uses a declarative language (YAML) to define the desired state of the system, making it easy to define and manage complex configurations.

Benefits of using Ansible for provisioning and automation:

Efficiency: Ansible enables administrators to automate manual tasks, reducing human error and increasing efficiency. Tasks that would normally take hours or days can be completed in a matter of minutes with Ansible.

Scalability: Ansible's agentless architecture allows it to scale seamlessly across a large number of servers. It can manage hundreds or even thousands of servers simultaneously, making it ideal for managing large fleets of servers.

Repeatability: Ansible playbooks can be version controlled and easily shared, ensuring that the same configurations and tasks can be applied consistently across different environments. This repeatability reduces the risk of configuration drift and provides a reliable and reproducible infrastructure.

**Q. You have been assigned the task of deploying a web application on multiple servers using Ansible. Explain the architecture and process flow of Ansible, highlighting how it can help you achieve efficient and consistent deployment across different environments. (6 marks)**

Ansible's architecture and process flow are essential for achieving efficient and consistent deployment across various environments. Here's an overview:

Architecture:
Ansible follows a client-server architecture with a control machine as the server and managed hosts as the clients. The control machine runs Ansible and manages inventory and playbooks, while the managed hosts are the target machines where tasks are executed.

Process Flow:

1. Inventory: The inventory file defines the hosts and groups managed by Ansible. It can be static or dynamic, allowing flexibility in managing different environments.
2. Playbooks: Written in YAML, playbooks define tasks to be executed on managed hosts. They can include variables, conditionals, loops, and roles for customization.
3. Modules: Ansible provides various modules responsible for specific tasks on managed hosts. These modules can be executed by playbooks or in ad-hoc commands.
4. Execution Types: Ansible supports linear, parallel, and local execution. Linear execution runs tasks sequentially, while parallel execution allows simultaneous execution on multiple hosts for improved performance. Local execution runs tasks on the control machine itself.
5. SSH Connectivity: Ansible uses SSH for connecting to managed hosts. SSH key-based authentication is recommended for secure connectivity.
6. Idempotence: Ansible ensures idempotent execution, meaning tasks are executed only if necessary. If a configuration is already in the desired state, Ansible skips the task.

By following this architecture and process flow, Ansible enables efficient and consistent deployment across different environments, making it a popular choice for automation.

 **Q. You need to install and configure a specific package on a group of servers using Ansible. Describe the process of using Ansible playbooks and modules to achieve this task. Explain the role of modules like 'apt', 'become', and 'with_items' in the playbook and how they contribute to successful package installation. (6 marks)**

Ansible playbooks provide a powerful way to install packages on remote servers. Here's a detailed explanation using the 'apt' module, along with other useful modules:

Playbook Example:

```yaml
---
- hosts: target_servers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install packages using apt
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      loop:
        - package1
        - package2

 - package3
...
```

Explanation:

- The playbook targets the hosts specified in the 'target_servers' group.
- The 'become' keyword allows the playbook to execute with root privileges.
- The 'apt' module is used to install packages specified in the 'loop' section.
- Each package is defined in the 'loop' as an item and installed using the 'state: present' option.

Other Useful Modules:

- 'become': This module allows privilege escalation, enabling tasks to be executed with elevated privileges (e.g., sudo).
- 'with_items': This module enables iteration over a list of items, allowing you to perform actions for each item.
- 'shell' or 'command': These modules execute shell commands on remote hosts, providing flexibility for various installation methods.

Remember to replace 'target_servers' with the appropriate host group from your inventory file and modify the package names to match your requirements.

**Q. You are managing a group of servers that provide different services. Using Ansible, describe how you can manage and control the services running on these servers. Explain the role of the 'service' module in Ansible and how it can be used to start, stop, and manage services effectively. (6 marks)**

Ansible provides the 'service' module for managing services on remote servers. Here's a detailed explanation:

Playbook Example:

```yaml
---
- hosts: server_group
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure service is running
      service:
        name: "{{ service_name }}"
        state: started
        enabled: yes
...
```

Explanation:

- The playbook targets the hosts specified in the 'server_group' group.
- The 'become' keyword allows the playbook to execute with root privileges.
- The 'service' module is used to manage services.
- The 'name' parameter specifies the service to manage, and 'state: started' ensures the service is running.
- The 'enabled: yes' option ensures the service starts automatically on system boot.

Remember to replace 'server_group' with the appropriate host group from your inventory file and modify the 'service_name' to match the service you want to manage.

Using these playbooks and modules, you can easily install packages and manage services on multiple servers, making system administration tasks more efficient and automated.

**Q. As a system administrator, you need to understand the fundamentals of Ansible inventory and configuration management. Discuss the importance of inventory in Ansible and explain the key concepts and fundamentals associated with inventory management.

Ansible inventory is a key component for managing hosts and groups. Here's a detailed explanation of Ansible inventory fundamentals:

Inventory File Example:

```
[target_servers]
server1 ansible_host=192.168.1.10
server2 ansible_host=192.168.1.11

[dbservers]
server1

```

Explanation:

- The inventory file defines the hosts and groups that Ansible manages.
- The `[target_servers]` group includes 'server1' and 'server2' as members, along with their corresponding IP addresses specified using the `ansible_host` variable.
- The `[dbservers]` group includes 'server1' as a member.

Key Concepts:

- Hosts: Represent individual servers or machines that Ansible manages. They can be identified by their names or IP addresses.
- Groups: Provide a way to organize hosts based on specific criteria, such as their role or functionality. Groups can contain one or more hosts.
- Variables: Inventory files allow defining variables that can be associated with hosts or groups. Variables can be used to customize playbook execution based on specific host or group properties.

**Q. Ansible offers a wide range of modules to perform various tasks on managed hosts. Discuss the fundamentals of Ansible modules and their significance in automation tasks. Provide real-life examples of how modules can be used to achieve specific automation goals. (6 marks)**

# UNIT V

## Docker

### What is Docker?

Docker is a platform for building, packaging, and deploying applications. Here are the key points to know:

1. Containerization: Docker uses containers to package applications and dependencies into standardized, lightweight units. Containers provide isolation, portability, and consistency, allowing applications to run reliably across different environments.
2. Portability: Docker containers can run on any system with Docker installed, eliminating compatibility issues and ensuring consistent behavior. This makes it easy to deploy applications across different environments.
3. Efficient Resource Utilization: Docker runs containers on a shared host operating system, resulting in faster startup times and reduced overhead.
4. Simplified Deployment: Docker makes it easy to define the application environment, dependencies, and configurations using Dockerfiles and Docker Compose files. This allows for easy replication and consistent deployment across different environments.
5. Scalability: Docker enables horizontal scalability by allowing multiple containers to run simultaneously based on the same image. This ensures high availability by distributing requests across multiple containers.
6. Robust Ecosystem: Docker has a wide range of tools, services, and community support, including Docker Hub and Docker Compose. Additionally, Docker integrates with orchestration tools like Kubernetes for managing containerized applications at scale.

Docker simplifies application development and deployment by providing a lightweight and portable platform. It enhances scalability, promotes application portability, and streamlines the deployment process, making it a valuable tool for modern software development workflows.

## Docker Architecture

The Docker architecture provides a standardized way to package and deploy applications across different environments.

At the heart of the Docker architecture is the Docker engine, which comprises several components. These include a daemon that runs on the host machine, a REST API that enables users to interact with the daemon, and a command-line interface (CLI) that lets users manage containers and images.

Docker images are the building blocks of the Docker architecture, containing all the necessary dependencies and configuration files required to run an application. These images can be stored in a centralized repository called a Docker registry, which can be either public or private.

When a user wants to run an application in a container, they start by pulling the required image from a registry. The Docker engine then creates a container from the image and isolates it from the host system, providing a lightweight and portable environment that can be easily deployed across different machines and platforms.

Overall, the Docker architecture provides a flexible and scalable approach to application development and deployment. This enables developers to streamline their workflows and reduce the complexity of managing applications in different environments.

### Benefits of Docker Container

1. Isolation: Docker containers provide isolated environments, ensuring that applications and their dependencies are encapsulated and do not interfere with each other.
2. Portability: Docker containers are highly portable, allowing applications to run consistently across different environments, from development to production.
3. Efficiency: Docker containers have low overhead, enabling efficient resource utilization and faster application startup times.
4. Scalability: Docker containers allow for easy horizontal scaling, enabling applications to handle increased workloads by running multiple instances of containers.

### Install Docker and Containerize a nginx server

1. Install Docker:
    - Visit the official Docker website (**[https://www.docker.com](https://www.docker.com/)**) and download the Docker installation package suitable for your operating system.
    - Follow the installation instructions specific to your OS.
    - Once the installation is complete, verify that Docker is running by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the command: **`docker version`**
2. Containerize Nginx:
    - Create a directory to hold your Nginx configuration and application files. For example, create a directory named "nginx-app".
    - Inside the "nginx-app" directory, create a file named "Dockerfile" (no file extension) and open it with a text editor.
    - In the Dockerfile, add the following lines:
        
        ```docker
        FROM nginx:latest
        COPY . /usr/share/nginx/html
        ```
        
    - Save and close the Dockerfile.
3. Build the Docker Image:
    - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the "nginx-app" directory.
    - Run the following command to build the Docker image:
        
        ```powershell
        docker build -t my-nginx-app .
        ```
        
    - This command builds the Docker image using the Dockerfile in the current directory and tags it with the name "my-nginx-app" (you can change the name as desired).
4. Run the Docker Container:
    - To run the container and expose port 8080, use the following command:
        
        ```powershell
        docker run -d -p 8080:80 my-nginx-app
        ```
        
    - This command starts the container in the background (**`d`** flag), maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 in the container (**`p 8080:80`** flag), and uses the image named "my-nginx-app" (replace with your image name).
5. Expose Port 3000 (Optional):
    - If you want to expose port 3000 as well, you can modify the Dockerfile to include additional configuration or modify the Nginx default configuration file within the container to listen on port 3000.
    - Rebuild the Docker image using the updated Dockerfile: **`docker build -t my-nginx-app .`**
    - Run the container again, this time mapping port 3000 to port 80 in the container: **`docker run -d -p 8080:80 -p 3000:80 my-nginx-app`**
6. Test the Nginx Application:
    - Open a web browser and visit **`http://localhost:8080`** (or **`http://localhost:3000`** if you exposed port 3000).
    - If everything is configured correctly, you should see the Nginx default welcome page.
    
    ### Managing Containers
    
    1. Stop containers:
        - **`docker stop <container_id>/<container_name>`**
        - **`docker ps`** (to list running containers)
    2. Start containers:
        - **`docker start <container_id>/<container_name>`**
        - **`docker ps`** (to list running containers)
    3. Remove containers:
        - **`docker rm <container_id>/<container_name>`**
        - **`docker ps -a`** (to list all containers)
        - **`docker rmi <image_id>/<image_name>`**
    4. Naming containers:
        - Docker automatically assigns random names to containers if not specified.
        - You can give a custom name to a container during creation:
        **`docker run --name <container_name> -d -p 8080:80 -p 3000:80 nginx:latest`**
        - **`docker ps`** (to check the container name)

### Volumes

Volumes in Docker:

1. Volumes provide a way to persist and share data between containers and the host machine.
2. They enable data to be stored separately from the container, ensuring data durability and allowing for easier data management.

Steps for Volumes between Host & Container:

1. Create a "website" folder on your Desktop.
2. Inside the "website" folder, create an "index.html" file with the following code: **`<h1>My name is Bond. James Bond..007</h1>`**
3. Stop and remove any running containers.
4. Open the command prompt, navigate to the "website" directory, and run the following command:

```powershell
docker run --name website -v %CD%:/usr/share/nginx/html -d -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
```

1. Open a web browser and visit "localhost:8080" to see the output: "My name is Bond. James Bond..007."
2. To check the folders inside the container, run the command:

```powershell
docker exec -it website bash
```

1. Create a folder inside the container, and you will find it in the "website" folder on your host machine.

Steps for Volumes between Containers:

1. Open Google and search for "Bootstrap Single Page Template."
2. Open the first website from the search results, choose a template, download the code, and paste it into the "website" folder.
3. Open a web browser and visit "localhost:8080" to view the website output.

### Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a set of instructions for building a Docker image. It specifies the base image to use, the files and dependencies to include, and the commands to run when the container is started. To create a Dockerfile, you can start with a basic text file and use Dockerfile instructions like `FROM`, `COPY`, `RUN`, and `CMD` to define the image's configuration and behavior. Once the Dockerfile is created, you can build an image using the `docker build` command, specifying the location of the Dockerfile.

## Kubernetes

### Introduction to Kubernetes:

1. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
2. It provides a container-centric infrastructure where applications are deployed and managed in a highly efficient and scalable manner.
3. Kubernetes abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on the application logic rather than the operational details of managing containers.
4. The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s". Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

### Kubernetes Features:

1. Container Orchestration: Kubernetes automates container deployment, scaling, and management.
2. Service Discovery and Load Balancing: Built-in mechanisms for efficient communication and traffic distribution.
3. Auto Scaling and Self-Healing: Automatic scaling based on demand and container recovery.
4. Configuration and Secrets Management: Flexible configuration and secure storage for sensitive information.
5. Rolling Updates and Rollbacks: Seamless updates and easy rollback to previous versions.

### Microservices:

1. Architecture with small, independent services.
2. Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
3. Promotes flexibility, agility, and resilience.
4. Lightweight communication protocols for decoupling and scalability.
5. Emphasizes DevOps practices and CI/CD.

2. Auto-scaling and load balancing was not possible.
3. Containers had to be manage carefully.

### Kubernetes Architecture

![Untitled](Cloud%20Computing%20b676dba0157549af9cbbb9405bbda7f3/Untitled%204.png)

![Untitled](Cloud%20Computing%20b676dba0157549af9cbbb9405bbda7f3/Untitled%205.png)

Components of Kubernetes architecture:

1. Master Node: Manages the cluster and coordinates communication between various components.
    1. kube-apiserver: This is the central management entity that handles REST requests for modifications to cluster resources. It communicates with etcd for data storage and ensures consistency between deployed pods and service details.
    2. kube-controller-manager: This is a background process that runs multiple controllers (e.g., replication, endpoints) to maintain the shared state of the cluster and perform routine tasks. It responds to changes in service configuration to achieve the desired state.
    3. cloud-controller-manager: This manages controllers with dependencies on the underlying cloud provider. It handles tasks like node termination checks, route setup, load balancers, and volumes in the cloud infrastructure.
    4. kube-scheduler: This is responsible for scheduling pods onto nodes based on resource utilization and operational requirements. It ensures optimal placement by considering available resources and existing workloads on each node.
    5. etcd: Distributed key-value store that stores the cluster's configuration data.
2. Worker Nodes: Host the containers and run the workload.
    1. kubelet: Agent running on each worker node, responsible for managing and monitoring containers.
    2. kube-proxy: Manages network communication within the cluster, providing networking services.
3. Container Runtime: Software responsible for running containers, such as Docker or containerd.
4. kubectl: Command-line tool for interacting with kube-apiserver and sending API calls to the master node.

### Working with Kubernetes

1. Create a manifest file (.yml): Define the desired state of the resources (e.g., pods, services, deployments) in a YAML file.
2. Apply the manifest to the cluster: Use the **`kubectl apply`** command to send the manifest to the Kubernetes master, which reconciles the desired state with the current state of the cluster.
3. Pods run on nodes controlled by the master: Kubernetes schedules pods, which are the basic units of deployment, onto available worker nodes in the cluster. The master node manages the scheduling and allocation of resources for the pods.

### Kubernetes Objects

- Kubernetes uses objects to represent the state of your cluster.
- It represents as JSON or YAML files.
- You create these files and then push them to Kubernetes API-server with Kubectl command.
- Once you create the object, the Kubernetes system will constantly work to ensure that object exist & maintain clusters desired state.
- Every Kubernetes object include two nested fields that governs the object configuration. “Object specification” and “object status”.
    - The specification which we provide, describes your “desired state” for the object.
    - The “Status” describes the “actual state” of the object & is supplied and updated by Kubernetes system.

### Kubernetes Concepts

- **Pod:** A unit of one or more containers that encapsulates application containers, storage resources, and network configuration.
- **Service:** Acts as a gateway, allowing client pods to send requests without needing to track the individual physical pods.
- **Volume:** Mounted on all containers within the pod, preserving data across container restarts.
- **Namespace:** Used for isolating resources, ensuring resource uniqueness, and limiting resource consumption.
- **Deployment:** Describes the desired state of a pod or replica set in a YAML file, with the deployment controller gradually updating the environment to match the desired state.
